**Q: Real-world scenario where vertical scaling is preferred**:

> In a scenario where a business is running a database that requires high performance, such as a large relational database like Oracle or MySQL, vertical scaling might be preferred. Databases can benefit from vertical scaling because it simplifies data consistency and query execution without the complexities of managing data across multiple servers, which can introduce latency and consistency challenges. 
> For instance, if a companyâ€™s database application needs better performance due to larger datasets or more transactions, adding more CPU and RAM to a single server (vertical scaling) can enhance performance without requiring architectural changes, as would be needed with horizontal scaling.
